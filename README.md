# FH5-AFK-Credits-and-XP-Farm

1. Download the main.exe file, located [here](https://github.com/KeksEntzug/FH5-AFK-Credits-and-XP-Farm/releases), by clicking on it.

2. Go in game and make sure you're somewhere in the normal overworld and driving the BMW X5 M. This is the best car for the goliath afk track.

3. Make sure your difficulty settings are all set to "Assisted" or "Automatic" and the drivatar difficulty is set to unbeatable.

4. Tab out of the game, open main.exe, go back into the game and press escape so you are not in the menu but able to drive in the overworld. If you messed up just restart the program.

5. You are done. Make sure to not mess with it too much while it's running. If you want to exit the program just close it.
