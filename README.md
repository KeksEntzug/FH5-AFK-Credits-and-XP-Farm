# FH5-AFK-Credits-and-XP-Farm

1. Download the main.exe file, located [here](https://github.com/KeksEntzug/FH5-AFK-Credits-and-XP-Farm/releases), by clicking on it.

2. Go in game and make sure you're somewhere in the normal overworld and driving the BMW X5 M. This is the best car for the goliath afk track.

3. Make sure your difficulty settings are all set to "Assisted" or "Automatic" and the drivatar difficulty is set to unbeatable.

4. Tab out of the game, open main.exe, go back into the game and press escape so you are not in the menu but able to drive in the overworld. If you messed up just restart the program.

5. You are done. Make sure to not mess with it too much while it's running. If you want to exit the program just close it.


# Features

1. The program auto teleports you to the goliath Track and starts a Community map automatically. I'm using this map because your car is very unlikely to crash.

2. The program auto sells cars from the wheelspin that you already own.


# Issues that likely might happen but I can't be bothered to fix right now:

1. If your screen isnt 1920 by 1080 it might not work.

2. The program won't choose the car you're driving at the moment if it doesn't see the BMW logo on the left- I'm not a BMW fan but the X5 is the best for the Goliath track so might aswell use it

3. It occasionally gets stuck in a loop. I have no idea why it does that but it might happen.
